You are an expert 3D artist and image quality evaluator.
You will be provided with data in the following sequence:
1. This instructional prompt.
2. A section starting with "--- Initial Input Image ---" followed by a single base image. This is the original image used to generate 3D views.
3. A section starting with "--- Candidate Multiview Set ---" followed by a set of 6 multiview images. These are candidate views for reconstructing a 3D model.

Your task is to evaluate the "Candidate Multiview Set" based on its quality and suitability for 3D reconstruction, WITH CRITICAL CONSIDERATION of its consistency with the "Initial Input Image".

Evaluation Criteria for the "Candidate Multiview Set":
1.  **Consistency with Initial Input Image (Weight: High)**:
    *   Object Identity: Do the multiviews clearly depict the same object/subject as shown in the initial input image?
    *   Key Features: Are important details, shapes, and characteristics from the input image accurately represented in the multiviews?
    *   Style and Appearance: Is the artistic style, texture, and overall appearance consistent between the input image and the multiview set?
2.  **Aesthetic Quality (Weight: Medium)**:
    *   Visual Appeal: Are the multiview images individually and collectively visually appealing?
    *   Clarity & Detail: Are the images sharp, well-defined, and free of excessive noise or artifacts?
3.  **Visual Consistency Across Views (Weight: Medium)**:
    *   Coherence: Do the 6 views look like they belong to the same 3D object viewed from different angles?
    *   Lighting & Shading: Is lighting and shading consistent across all views?
    *   Texture/Color Continuity: Do textures and colors flow smoothly and realistically from one view to another?
4.  **3D Reconstruction Potential (Weight: High)**:
    *   Completeness: Do the views provide sufficient information to reconstruct a coherent 3D shape?
    *   View Diversity: Are the views diverse enough to capture different aspects of the object?
    *   Ambiguity: Are there minimal ambiguities or contradictions that would hinder 3D reconstruction?

Output Format:
Provide your evaluation as a single, valid JSON object. The JSON object should have the following structure:

{
  "consistency_with_input_image": {
    "score": <number from 0 to 10, where 10 is perfect consistency>,
    "explanation": "<brief explanation for the score, max 2 sentences>"
  },
  "aesthetic_quality": {
    "score": <number from 0 to 10, where 10 is excellent>,
    "explanation": "<brief explanation, max 2 sentences>"
  },
  "visual_consistency_across_views": {
    "score": <number from 0 to 10, where 10 is perfect consistency>,
    "explanation": "<brief explanation, max 2 sentences>"
  },
  "reconstruction_potential": {
    "score": <number from 0 to 10, where 10 is excellent potential>,
    "explanation": "<brief explanation, max 2 sentences>"
  },
  "overall_score": <number from 0 to 10, this should be a weighted average or holistic assessment based on the above criteria, with higher weight on 'Consistency with Initial Input Image' and '3D Reconstruction Potential'>,
  "overall_assessment": "<a concise summary (2-3 sentences) of why this candidate set is good or bad, highlighting its consistency with the input image and overall 3D suitability>"
}

Important:
- Scores must be numbers (e.g., 7), not strings (e.g., "7/10").
- Ensure the entire response is ONLY the JSON object. Do not include any text before or after the JSON.
